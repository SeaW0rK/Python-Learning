   "source": "# Homework #4 - Introduction to Iterables - Strings\n## Assignment Description \nThere are three parts to this assignment. First, some basic practice with many of the fundamental skills we learned in class. Second, another set of problems which will challenge you to use your critical thinking skills and fundamental code skills to answer coding challenges. Finally, practice with intelligence writing. \n\n# Assignment\n## Python Practice\nPlease complete all of the items in this Google Form and submit the Google Form once complete:\nhttps://forms.gle/dG7GQeBn26bSULQD7\n\n\n## Python Problem Solving Practice\nAnswer all of the questions included in this notebook below. \n\n## Practice with Intelligence Writing\nFind a piece of writing writing focused on a cyber attack of some kind and rewrite the piece using intel writing best practices. At the end of your report include a dedicated section in which you list all of the IOCs included in the report and ensure all of them are defanged. If your report didn't include IOCs go find IOCs related to this particular attack from a different source and cite where they came from. \n\n(Hint: You could find a piece written in a major news source such as the NYT or Washington Post or a piece written in a technology publication such as Wired or TechCrunch or you could even find a piece written on a cybersecurity specific news source such as krebsonsecurity or darkreading.)",

E.g. if your code is run on the character 'a' it will output the unicode value of 'A' (which is 65). Hint: we recommend using the built-in function ord() (see https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html?highlight=ord#ord).",

You're provided with all of the code to handle the loop and the structure for the list. This will hopefully give you a chance to see these structures in action and start to see what they are about before you have to write them yourself. If you are confused, remember to use your book or look online to better understand what you're seeing.\n\nYou’re renting an air-bnb. You change the code for each guest. The other night, someone tried the door code and then broke in after it failed. You suspect it was a former renter and if you can figure out who was issued the code they tried, maybe that will be a lead. \n\nYou have all your old texts from the app. Write some code that can extract the passcodes from your messages and compare them against the one used to try the door (1234).\n\nYou will be provided with some code that will cause your logic to run against every keycode message provided. If you get a match, print the full text!\n\nHere are some examples of texts that you can assume are a representative sample.\n\n* “Jen - The passcode is: 2222”\n* “Armand - I almost forgot! Your passcode for tonight: 9876”\n* “Mike - the passcode is: 1234”\n* “Carmen - the back door code - it's 9999”\n",
